# 🐱 Mika — A Cute Desktop Cat (Birthday Gift Project)

This is a Python project for a cute desktop cat. Her name is **Mika**, and she loves eating pizza.  
I implemented a little **cat language translator** for her so she can speak with you!  
I made this project as a **birthday gift for my husband** 💛  

> *(The project still needs a few adjustments; I'm actively working on it!)*
